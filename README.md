## Credits

I am a fan of [Endless Acid Banger](https://www.vitling.xyz/toys/acid-banger) by [Vitling](https://www.vitling.xyz). I find it the perfect music to listen to while coding.

I wanted to be able to pause and resume the music. So while I was at it I also changed the UI, removed a bunch of code and added a new visualizer. The result is the current version. A simplified version of the original. Press Play to start the music.

It's based on his work on Github, [here](https://github.com/vitling/endless-acid-banger). Rebuilt in JavaScript instead of TypeScript because I wanted to be able to run it with no buildsteps.
